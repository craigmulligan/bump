# Bump ðŸ‘Š

> A tiny tool for interactively bumping semver git tags.

## Usage

Bump guides you through cutting a new version by a series of prompts so you can usually get things done by calling `bump` alone.

## Why?

I couldn't find a script that worked the way I wanted. At work, everything is deployed via git tags, so you often have to pull tags get the latest figure out how you'd like to bump it etc etc, this speeds up that workflow and reduce silly mistakes.
